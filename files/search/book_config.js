Long\u000d\u000aPreface Digital transformation requires digital readiness! Increased digitalization requires \u000d\u000ainvestments in the digital readiness of people, especially in emerging technologies like \u000d\u000aArtificial Intelligence, for countries to remain competitive in the global economy. \u000d\u000aDigital readiness encompasses skills, trust, and responsible use of technology for broader \u000d\u000asocio-economic benefits. We are driving digital readiness programs with the objective of \u000d\u000aempowering current and future workforces with appropriate skill sets, mindsets, toolsets, \u000d\u000aand opportunities to use technology impactfully and responsibly in an AI-fueled world.\u000d\u000aIn Asia Pacific and Japan (APJ), we have to date empowered more than 385,000 youth \u000d\u000aand 2.75 million citizens on AI readiness by collaborating with 10+ governments in 10 \u000d\u000acountries. We have also skilled 5,600+ APJ public sector leaders under the Digital \u000d\u000aReadiness for Leaders program.\u000d\u000aThis impact would not have been possible without all our partners in Government, \u000d\u000aAcademia, and Civil Society who joined us on this journey. Together, we built multiple \u000d\u000atransformative public-private-partnership initiatives that have enabled indigenous AI \u000d\u000ainnovations to make technology fully inclusive and expand digital readiness for all. \u000d\u000aStudents from various digital readiness programs have participated and showcased their AI \u000d\u000aprojects at the Intel\u00ae AI Global Festival 2022, competing with finalists from over 25 \u000d\u000acountries across the globe. It\u2019s an amazing showcase of world-changing ideas from student \u000d\u000adevelopers and future innovators on the theme \u201cEnriching Lives with Innovations.\u201d \u000d\u000aDeveloped in alignment with the UN SDGs and as part of the Intel\u00ae Digital Readiness \u000d\u000aPrograms, these projects showcase the potential of AI for a sustainable future. I am thrilled \u000d\u000ato share the collection of the winning impactful APJ projects titled \u201cAI Changemakers\u201d. \u000d\u000aAs we look ahead to 2023, our ambitions have never been greater. We will continue working \u000d\u000awith our government partners towards increasing digital readiness and empowering every \u000d\u000aperson with AI social and technical skills in an inclusive way to accelerate digital \u000d\u000atransformation.\u000d\u000aCorporate Vice President, \u000d\u000aGeneral Manager, Asia Pacific and \u000d\u000aJapan, Intel\u000d\u000a4","Sarah Kemp\u000d\u000aAcknowledgement\u000d\u000aAt Intel, leading technological transformation means ensuring the world is prepared for \u000d\u000athe changes to come. Aligned with the purpose of 'creating world-changing technology \u000d\u000athat improves the life of every person on the planet,' we have launched a comprehensive \u000d\u000adigital readiness program portfolio to address the global digital skills crisis.\u000d\u000aWe want to thank the students who have shared their innovative solutions and ideas for \u000d\u000aleveraging AI and creating social impact; and acknowledge the contribution of the \u000d\u000aparents, teachers, and academic institutions who have supported the students during \u000d\u000athis journey.\u000d\u000aOur bold aspiration of empowering youth with Artificial Intelligence (AI) social and \u000d\u000atechnology skills in an inclusive way was only achieved with exemplary public-private \u000d\u000apartnerships.
